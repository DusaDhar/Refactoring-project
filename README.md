This is a code refactoring project for the Horiseon webpage.
We were given the html code and its css stylesheet of a webpage for a marketing company called HORISEON. 
I updated the html code using html semantics and regrouped css attributes. 
I also added comments to make the code easier to read.

Here's a screenshot of what the webpage looks like:
